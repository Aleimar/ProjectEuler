## The square root of any prime number is irrational.

In hopes of improving my mathematical algorithms, I reviewed some concepts and
recalled this specific property of prime numbers.

# Proof by contradiction

Let's assume *p* is any prime number and that $\sqrt{p}$ is rational.

Then, there are natural numbers *m* and *n* such that:

$\sqrt{p}$ = $\frac{m}{n}$

p = $\frac{m^2}{n^2}$
